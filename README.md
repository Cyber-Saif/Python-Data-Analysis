# Python-Data-Analysis
### A Python-based data analysis tool designed to extract specific insights from a large dataset stored in green vancouver.txt. The program:
**1. Analyzes and filters information related to green building projects, especially in Downtown.
2. Identifies projects missing website details.
3. Extracts projects containing the keyword "bike" in their description.
4. Compiles a list of unique local areas mentioned in the dataset.**

### This project demonstrates effective file handling, data parsing, and custom filtering for meaningful insights from large text-based datasets.
